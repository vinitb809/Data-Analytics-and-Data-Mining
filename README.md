# Predicting Default Risk of Lending Club Loans

Abstract - This research discusses many factors that contribute to default on loans. It is important from the lender's viewpoint because if the borrower is not able to repay the loan, there is no established governing body to reconcile. Being a Peer-to-Peer lending site, the data presented are not reliable, making it difficult for the lender to get a good picture of whether he can take the risk of accepting a borrower's proposal. The research is based on data from the Lending Club from 2007 to 2015, which is first evaluated by performing an exploratory analysis to determine the most predictive variables for defaults in loans. Hence, the idea of this project is to gather loan data from the Lending Club website and use different data analytics techniques on this data to extract important information and predict if a customer would be able to repay the loan or not. In other words, the goal is to predict if the customer would be a defaulter or not. Logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbor are used to model defaults.

Summary - During the research, we have used the CRISP-DM methodology to achieve the final target. In the dataset, there were many missing values present we have dealt with using a missing data imputer. For feature extraction, we have used various approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Also, data is imbalanced, so we have used cross-validation techniques to minimize the data and for modeling, we have used and compared two machine learning approaches logistic regression and K- Nearest Neighbor for predicting the status of the applicant.
